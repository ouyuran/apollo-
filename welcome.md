Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited you're here to learn about Apollo.

Apollo is a platform for building a **data graph**, a communication layer that seamlessly connects application clients \(such as React and iOS apps\) to back-end services.

It's easy to adopt Apollo incrementally, meaning you can set it up alongside an existing solution \(such as a REST API\) and migrate functionality at your convenience.

## Learn the basics

Conveniently, we have a [tutorial](https://github.com/ouyuran/apollo-basics-cn/tree/956bb843c528a5552a48ee4f6fbb302e2b95c699/tutorial/introduction/README.md) that introduces you to each component of the platform. Ready to dive in?
